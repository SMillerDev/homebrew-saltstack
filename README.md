# Saltstack Casks

## How do I install these casks?
`brew install smillerdev/saltstack/<cask>`

Or `brew tap smillerdev/saltstack` and then `brew install --cask <cask>`.

## Why do I install these casks?

Sometimes you can't use the [Formula](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/salt) that brew provides so you want to use the upstream installer, this tap allows brew to do that for you.

## Documentation
`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
